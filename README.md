# Lab 2 - Node.js Modules Assignment (JS Frameworks)

This project is for Lab Assignment 2 in the JS Frameworks course.

### Project Description

The main goal of this assignment was to demonstrate the use of **ES Modules** for server-side JavaScript.

The project has two files:

1.  **`utils.js`**: This file is a utility module that creates and exports four different functions, including an age calculator, a string reversal function, and an average calculator.
2.  **`index.js`**: This is the main file. It uses the `import` statement to call and execute the four functions from `utils.js`.

### How to Run

To run the application, you must have Node.js installed on your computer.

1.  Open your terminal or PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
3.  Type the command below:

```bash
node index.js
